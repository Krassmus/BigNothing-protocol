BigNothing-protocol
===================

A draft for a federated social or collaborative network.

The motivation for this protocol is [this blog-entry "Ballad of Big Nothing"](http://distributedcode.wordpress.com/2014/02/26/ballad-of-big-nothing/).

We are seeking a protocol for a federated or distributed social network that is flexible, secure and extendable. Our goals:

* Use simple asynchronous RSA-encryption and signing for security and authentication.
* Allow end-to-end-encryption for a strong security.
* Management of multiple identities per login.
* Sharing one identity with multiple logins/persons.
* Flexible data-format for flexible contents.
* Handling groups with well a defined logic.
